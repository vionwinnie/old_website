Hi every one, this is where I showcase my data science projects. I have started learning concepts related to Data Science, Statistics, and Computer Science about 1.5 years ago. Itâ€™s been a fascinating journey so far. I realize that I learn best by putting theories into real-life cases and hence this website. Feel free to email me if you have any suggestions and questions.

### Personal History

I grew up from Hong Kong, attended United World College in Hong Kong and then studied at Middlebury College in Vermont, USA on full scholarship. I majored in Middle Eastern history and minor in Mathematics and Arabic. I even studied abroad in Jordan for an entire year! I see connections of my undergrad study with data science: historical inquiry requires you to step into the shoes of historical figures, understand the cause and origins of historical phenomena, to collect and interpret hisotical sources. These skills are similar to the critical thinking skills one requires in Data Science, for example, meaningful feature engineering or bagging to obtain a more unbiased parameter estimation. In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, reading, photography, and traveling.
