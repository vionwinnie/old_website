Here are the list of projects that I have been working on:

## Major Projects
 
- [Looking for the True Yelp Rating](YelpReview.html) 
- [Star Hong Kong Stock Picker](starstockpicker.html)
 
 
## Others :
 
**Projects I have done to familiarize myself with coding, visualization, and statistic concepts (in iPython notebook or PDF format):**
- Dictionary of Anna Karenina - Python Dictionary, IF-ITF in Natural Language Processing

  This is my first hands-on Python project. 


- Predicting BMI from countries around the world - Regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA, Regression Assumption Diagnostics

  My STAT E-150 Project team collects about 150 socioeconomic data for countries around the world and we regress these variables with mean BMI of these countries. Through this exercise, we want to identify what are the variables that can explain the variations in BMI across the globe. 
  
  
- [Predicting Black Friday Sales](https://github.com/vionwinnie/vionwinnie.github.io/blob/master/sideproj/BlackFridayRegressionModel.ipynb) - Regression, Multicollinearity
 
   I have joined this Analytics Vidhya contest. While others in the competition have used xgboost to construct their models, I have used this dataset to strengthen my foundation in regression analysis and diagonstics.
 
 
## Resources:
I read and look for ideas on these websites regularly:
 
- [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/) - Great website with posts on different techniques and case samples
- [D3.JS](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery) - Examples for customized data visualization 
 
 Quora, cross validation, and stack overflow are also must-go if you learn best by asking questions and replying to questions.
