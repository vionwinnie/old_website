    "The key comparison from here is that Anna Karenina is addressed most of the time as Anna, being referenced in conversations or called by her closed ones. Where as for her lover and husband, last name is usually referenced. But her husband, Alexey Alexandrovitch, the full name is often cited. Who is the main character in the book? It's actually interesting that Vronsky's mentions is slightly higher than Anna Kareinan's. However, we can think of it as - 1) Vronsky is mentioned frequenctly in Anna's words or 2) author uses the technique of describing Anna by painting a picture of surroundings including Vronsky. It would be an interesting next project to discover who talks in the most int he novel!"
