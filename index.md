## Introduction

Hi every one, this is where I showcase my data science projects. I have started learning concepts related to Data Science, Statistics, and Computer Science about 1.5 years ago. It's been a fascinating journey so far. I realize that I learn best by putting theories into real-life cases and hence this website. Feel free to email me if you have any suggestions and questions. 

## Acknowledgement

My webpage is modeled after AM207 github design for its clean design. This is my first Jeykll blog design. I will work on modifying it to something that I can display my nature photography.
