## Introduction

Hi every one, this is where I showcase my data science projects. I became fascinated with Data Science on the job and decided to study a master degree in analytics at Georgia Tech. During the past year, I have been honing my skills on core ML modeling and diagnostics, Computer Vision (CV), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, implemented with both baseline techniques and Deep Learning algorithms. It's been a fascinating journey so far. I realize that I learn best by putting theories into real-life cases and hence this website. Feel free to email me if you have any suggestions and questions ![dcvionwinnie@gmail.com]

### Personal History

I grew up from Hong Kong, attended United World College in Hong Kong and then studied at Middlebury College in Vermont, USA on full scholarship. I majored in Middle Eastern history and minor in Mathematics and Arabic. I even studied abroad in Jordan for an entire year! After undergrad, I work at Fidelity Investments for 2.5 years in Boston and in Hong Kong. Then life took me next to Georgia Tech where I completed a Master's degree in Analytics.

I see connections of my prior study in humanities with data science: historical inquiry requires you to step into the shoes of historical figures, understand the cause and origins of historical phenomena, to collect and interpret hisotical sources. These skills are similar to the critical thinking skills one requires in Data Science, for example, meaningful feature engineering or bagging to obtain a more unbiased parameter estimation. Ultimately, both discipline seek to interpret and explain phenomena and human behavior. Additionally, Data Science has a prediction dimension to it, focusing on forecasting the future with the current data, which influence behaviors and improve operational efficiency. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, reading, photography, and traveling.
