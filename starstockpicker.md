# Introduction

Traditional quant models combine signals classify stocks by a top down approach: it assigns a fixed percentage for each signal and combine them altogether for a composite score. I am curious to see if deploying machine learning techniques can help improve betting averages of the stockpicking. My hypothesis is that these machine learning techniques can detect closer relationship of different metrics, assign better weights for different metrics, and thus draw a better separation plane between rising and declining stocks. 

**Topic:** Comparing Performance of Random Forest Classifier Model (RF) with traditionial quant factor model (TR)

**Benchmark:** Hang Seng Index (HSI) 

**Timeframe:** 2000-2017 Monthly Data 

# Project Flow 

## Data Collection & Feature Selection

I have extracted HSI constituents and the dates of changes in index composition. I saved each security as an individual csv. There are about 60 securities.

For each security, I have extracted 25 base features, including price, cash from operations, earnings, forward P/E, daily volume, short interest, dividend and so on. I then derived 194 factors I have engineered from the base features, grouped into different categories. These categories capture different parts of the stock, from fundamental, momentum, market expectation. Some of them are averages, differences, and Z score of one metrics. Click [Here]{: Feature Table} to see the feature table.

## Data Preprocessing 

1. Before standardizing the data, I first load it into my iPython interpreter through the following function *DataProcessing()*. The function will return two data items: 

1) a dictionary of stock-level data with classifier label ( 1,0 based on forward 1-month excess return) Â 
2) a dictionary of constituents at each time period

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import glob, time, os

## Loading Dateparse for reading dataframes
dateparse = lambda x: pd.datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d')


def DataProcessing(hsi_path, feature_path, stock_path, index_path):
    ### Reading Index Data
    dateparse = lambda x: pd.datetime.strptime(x, '%Y-%m-%d')
    HSI = pd.read_csv(hsi_path,header=2,parse_dates=['date'],date_parser=dateparse)
    new_name = ['date']
    for s in HSI.columns.tolist():
        if s != 'date':
            new_name.append('HSI_'+s) 
        
    HSI.columns = new_name
    
    ## Loading the column name lists to select the desired features
    column_selection= pd.read_excel(feature_path,sheetname=0,header=0,index_col=False)['Column'].tolist()
    column_selection = [s.encode("utf-8") for s in column_selection]   ### Encode as string 
    
    ## Reading Stock Level Data
    paths = glob.glob(stock_path)
    stock = {}
    for path in paths:
        stock_name = path.split("\\")[-1].split(".")[0]
        intermediary = pd.read_csv(path,header=2,parse_dates=['date'],date_parser=dateparse,usecols=column_selection)
        
        ## Merge HSI with stock level 
        intermediary = pd.merge(intermediary,HSI,how='left',on='date')
        
        ## Adding the classifier tab
        intermediary['classifier'] = intermediary['TotalReturnIndex_Chg_1M']> intermediary['HSI_Chg_1M']
        intermediary['classifier'] = intermediary['classifier'].shift(-1)
        intermediary['Forward_Chg_1M'] = intermediary['TotalReturnIndex_Chg_1M'].shift(-1)
        intermediary['stock_tag'] = stock_name.replace('-HK','')  ##Added Stock Tags 
        stock[stock_name] = intermediary    
    
    ## Loading Index Constituents Addition And Deletion File 
    dateparse2 = lambda x: pd.datetime.strptime(x, '%Y%m%d')
    HSI_changes= pd.read_excel(index_path,sheetname=0,header=0,index_col=False)
    
    ## Create Dictionary of Constituents According to Each Period In Time  
    ticker_date_dict = {}
    index = []
    
    for i in range(0,len(HSI_changes)):  
        ticker = HSI_changes.iloc[i,:]
        name = ticker['Ticker']
        dates = pd.Series(pd.date_range(start=dateparse2(str(ticker['Start_Date'])), end=dateparse2(str(ticker['End_Date'])), freq='M')).tolist()  
        for date in dates:
            index.append(date)
        ticker_date_dict[name]=dates
    
    unique_dates= list(set(index))
    inverted = {}
    for cool in unique_dates:
        inverted.setdefault(cool, [])  ## Default an empty index
    for k,v in ticker_date_dict.items():
        for m in v:
            inverted[m].append(k)

    return inverted, stock

IndexData_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'Output/ExchangeFactor/HSI.csv') 
FeatureSelection_path =  os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'Input/StockLevel/FeatureSelection.xlsx')
StockLevelSearch_path =  os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'Output/StockLevel/*.csv')
Index_Add_Drop_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'Input/StockLevel/Constituent_Addition_Removal.xlsx')
    
timeframe_dict, stock_dictionary= DataProcessing(IndexData_path,FeatureSelection_path,StockLevelSearch_path,Index_Add_Drop_path)
```
2. With timeframe_dict and stock_dictionary at hand, we can now proceed to reshape the data to form cross-section for each time period and then split the data into training and testing set. I'm using an expanding window approach, therefore this is my home-made test_train_split, different from the sklearn standardized function. 

```python
def TestTrainSplit_TimeSeries(timeframe_dict, stock_dictionary,periodicity):
    
    " timeframe_dict: The list of time periods in the stocks"
    " stock_dictionary: The dictionary in which I loaded the stock level data"
    " periodicity: The number of periods I want to include in each training period" 
    
    
    # Sorting the list of time periods 
    times = timeframe_dict.keys()
    times.sort()
    
    ## forming a cross section 
    month_set = {}     
    
    for period in times:
        securities = timeframe_dict[period]
        
        for i,security in enumerate(securities):
            test_df = stock_dictionary[security]
            line = test_df[test_df['date']==period]
            
            if i ==0:
                month = line
            else:
                month = pd.concat([month,line])
        
        month = month.drop(['date'],1) ## Remove Date Column
        npp = change_value(np.array(month).transpose()) ## Convert to Numpy Array for easing the operation
        
        month_set[period]=npp
    
    ## Splitting Features and Labels in training and testing sets
    train_set_num = xrange(periodicity,len(timeframe_dict))
    train_set = []   
    train_label_set = []
    
    test_set = []
    test_label_set = []
    test_stock_set = []
    
    for i in train_set_num:
        
        if i < len(timeframe_dict)-1 :
            
            allArrays = np.concatenate([month_set[times[x]] for x in range(i)],axis=1)
        
            labels = allArrays[-2]  ## Separate the labels column
            allArrays = allArrays[:-2] ## Drop the labels column
            
            train_set.append(allArrays)
            train_label_set.append(labels)
            
            testArrays = month_set[times[i+1]]
            testlabels = testArrays[-2]
            testtags = testArrays[-1]
            testArrays = testArrays[:-2]
        
            test_set.append(testArrays)
            test_label_set.append(testlabels)
            test_stock_set.append(testtags)
    
    return train_set, train_label_set, test_set, test_label_set,test_stock_set
 
 TrainFeatureSet, TrainLabelSet, TestFeatureSet, TestLabelSet, TestStockTagsSet = TestTrainSplit_TimeSeries(timeframe_dict, stock_dictionary,para.period)
```

## Standardization And Random Forest Classifier:
For each training set, I first replace the NaN value with the column mean and then feed the training set to 
I then use the sklearn toolkit to run my random forest classifier. To avoid overfitting, I set the maximum depth of the trees to be 10. 

Because this is a time series data where the latest week's prediction is influenced by the most recent week's data points, I have decided to train and test my model with an expanding window approach. For predicting Sep 2017 stock picking for example, I will first train my model with Jan 2004-Aug 2017 data and then use the model parameters for September prediction. 

![Alt Text](/assets/TrainingMethodology.PNG)

Here's the code to run the model for each period and visualize the results in charts:
```python
def random_forest_classifier(features, target,MaxDepth=None):
    """
    Reference: http://dataaspirant.com/2017/06/26/random-forest-classifier-python-scikit-learn/
    To train the random forest classifier with features and target data
    :param features:
    :param target:
    :return: trained random forest classifier
    """
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth = MaxDepth)
    clf.fit(features, target)
    return clf

 Â  Â ## We use the training set to ubi 
 Â  Â accuracy_score_list = []
    for i in range(0,len(TestFeatureSet)-1):
            
    ## Starting the Training across different dataset 
    accuracy_score_list = []
    for i in range(0,len(TestFeatureSet)-1):
        
        a = TrainFeatureSet[i]
        b = np.where(np.invert(np.isfinite(a)), np.ma.array(a, mask=np.invert(np.isfinite(a))).mean(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis], a)  
        ## np. newaxis is used to increase the dimension of the existing array by one more dimension
        
        ## Standardize the features to [-1,1]
        Scale = preprocessing.Normalizer()
        b = Scale.fit_transform(b)        
        trained_model = random_forest_classifier(b.transpose(), TrainLabelSet[i],10)
    
 Â  Â  Â  Â ## Normalize the Test Set and Make Predict using the trained model
 Â  Â  Â  Â c = TestFeatureSet[i]
        d = np.where(np.invert(np.isfinite(c)), np.ma.array(c, mask=np.invert(np.isfinite(c))).mean(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis], c)
        d = Scale.transform(d)
        predicted_x = trained_model.predict(d.transpose())
        accuracy_score_list.append(accuracy_score(TestLabelSet[i],predicted_x))
    
    accuracy_plot(timeframe_dict,accuracy_score_list,para.period)

# Random Forest Model Evaluation  

## Here are the reuslts for Random Forest Model:
**Avg. accuracy score is :** 0.56

**SD of accuracy score is :** 0.06

**Runtime:** 63.5 secs

![Alt Text](/assets/AUCScoreChart.png)
![Alt Text](/assets/AccuracyScoreChart.png)

Even though the accuracy score seems low compared to other classification problems, but in the context of stock picking, a betting average of 55% percent already makes you a rock star. Therefore, it is encouraging to see my accuracy score on average has 56% and with some approaching 60%. 

# Traditional Quant Model:
Using the same dataset, I built the simple quant model, picking 3 metrics from each of the Earnings Momentum (25%), Quality (25%), and Valuation (50%) aspects.At each period, each stock will receive a weighted score from these three aspects and grouped into quintiles. In my portfolio, I will long the top quintile stocks within the for index and rebalance my holdings monthly. For this part, I have utilized Factset and not by Python. 

Here are the results:

|Category | Factor | Information Coefficient|
|----- | ------ | -------------|
| Overall Model | | 0.01|
| Earnings Momentum | PE NTM | 0.01|
| Earnings Momentum | Pct Change in 9 months | 0.03|
| Valuation | EV/ EBITDA | 0.03|
| Valuation | IBES Earnings Estimate Dispersion | 0.07|
| Valuation | FCF Margin | 0.03|
| Quality | Net Debt | 0.03|
| Quality | Accruals | 0.01|

We could see that the individual factors are strongly correlated with the stocks returns howver, the current combination is not the strongest as the IC is almost zero, meaning the distribution of the score is as random as flipping a coin. 

# Portfolio Performance
Because of the asymmetric nature of investment, picking the strongest stocks within the index and hold them would pay off handsomely even though we might miss the smaller one. Such asymmetric payoff is even more apparent when we look at the portfolio strategy of the model.

From a cumulative return perspective, RF delivers annualized excess return of 7% per year while Quant model returns 5%. From 2005 to 2017, RF outperforms benchmark by 200% while QR outperforms by 130%.
