## Major Projects

- [Looking for the True Yelp Rating](policies.html) 
- [Star Hong Kong Stock Picker](starstockpicker.html)


## Others:

**Projects I have done to familiarize myself with coding, visualization, and statistic concepts:**
- Dictionary of Anna Karenina
- Predicting BMI from countries around the world 
- Predicting Black Friday Sales (from Analytics Vidhya)


## Resources:
I read and look for ideas on these websites regularly:

- [Analytics Veidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/) - Great website with posts on different techniques and case samples
- [D3.JS](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery) - Examples for customized data visualization 


Quora, cross validation, and stack overflow are also must-go if you learn best by asking questions and replying to questions.
